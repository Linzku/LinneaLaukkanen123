        The <strong>cat</strong>  (<strong><i>Felis catus</i></strong> ) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred 
        to as the <strong>domestic cat</strong> or <strong>house cat</strong> to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. Cats are commonly 
        kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact. 
        Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.
